I am a big fan of the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), but always struggled to apply its rigid format to my work as a programmer. This it the attempt to write a flexible & minimalistic Pomodoro timer.

Intervals and breaks can be started and ended by the user:

- Right before and after the ideal duration of a single pomodoro, the user should be softly reminded to take a break.
- After ignoring the warning period, the user will be urged to take a break.

# Roadmap

- [Release] Create MVP
- [Feature] Show history of pomodoros
- [Feature] Break management
